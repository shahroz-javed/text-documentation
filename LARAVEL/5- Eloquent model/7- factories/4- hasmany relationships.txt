//require by convention
User,Post model
posts relationship method in User model



//if not follow convention
has(Post::factory()->count(3), 'posts')



//magic method
$user = User::factory()->hasPosts(3, ['published' => false,])->create();


look for posts relationship in User model
sec arg to overide attributes

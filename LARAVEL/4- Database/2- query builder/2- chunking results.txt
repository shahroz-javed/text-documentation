retrieves a small chunk of results at a time and feeds each chunk into a closure for processing
must use orderBy


//chunking results
DB::table('users')->orderBy('id')->chunk(5, function ($users) {
        foreach ($users as $user) {
            //perform an action against $user
            DB::table('users')
                ->where('id', $user->id)
                ->update(['email_verified_at' => Carbon::now()]);
        }
    });


//stop further chunks from being processed
return false;

//if you want to update
chunkById()

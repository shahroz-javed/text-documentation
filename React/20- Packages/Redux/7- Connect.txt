By setup we will have access to state and dispatch method

import { connect } from 'react-reduxâ€™




const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return { amount: state.userreducer }
}

Export default connect(mapStateToProps,{getPosts})(Navbar)






//authreducer is reducer name we specify in combine reducer file
import userreducer from './user'

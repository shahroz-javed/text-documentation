key can either be an intor a string
The value can beof any type. 


Additionally the following key casts will occur: 
◦ Strings containing valid decimal ints will be cast to the int type.
◦ Floats are also cast to ints.  
◦ Bools are cast to ints, too.
◦ Null will be cast to the empty string.  
◦ Arrays and objects can not be used as keys.Doing so will result in a warning: Illegal offset type. 



If multiple elements in the array declaration use the same key, only the last onewill be used.
key is optional. If it is not specified, PHP willuse the increment of the largest previously used int key.
